# homebrew-taps
 üçª My custom taps for the missing package manager for macOS https://brew.sh

* **NIBTools (2014r649) - Commodore 1541/1571 disk image nibbler**  
  *(C) 2004-12 Peter Rittwage, Markus Brenner, and friends*  
  Based on routines from MNIB, which is (C) 2000-04 Markus Brenner.
  
  Pete has graciously granted me permission to provide this tap, which provides Mac users an easy way to checkout his SVN source, compile and install the programs: nibread, nibwrite, nibconv, nibscan, nibrepair and nibsrqtest.  This tap will install dependencies from formulae as necessary: libusb, libusb-compat, cc65 and opencbm.
  
  To install, simply type:  
  **brew install percival41/homebrew-taps/nibtools**
